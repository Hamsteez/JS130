A Test Suite is the entire set of tests that accompanies your program or application. 
  You can think of it as all of the tests for a project.

A Test is a specific situation or context that you're attempting to test. 
  For instance, a test may attempt to verify that you get an error message when you try to log in with the wrong password. 
  Each test can contain multiple assertions. You may sometimes see tests referred to as specs.
  
An Assertion is the verification step that confirms that your program did what it should. 
  In particular, many assertions test whether the return value of a function or method matches the expected results. 
  You can make multiple assertions within a test. Assertions are also called expectations.
