- The var Statement
  Using var at the top level of a program creates a property on the global object. `let` does not do that. When var is used within
    a function, the variable is not stored as a property of the global object. -This is when we use Node REPL and not in a file
  `let` is block scoped
  var is function scoped.

- Scope
  Visibility Scope - where a particular identifier (variable, function or class name) is available for use by your code. If it is
    available throughout your code, it has a global scope, otherwise it has local scope.

  Declared Scope - How a particular identifier is declared.

  Lexical Scope - Lexical structure of your code. Lexical scope distinguishes between variables that are declared inside a function
    or block and the variables that are declared outside a function or block.

  - Visibility Scope - Global or local scope
    - Global
    - Local
      - Local block
      - Local function
    `var` is either global or local function
    `let` is either global or local block or local function

  - Declared Scope - Block or function scope
    - Block scope: `let`, `const`, `class`
    - Function scope: `var`, `function`

  - Lexical Scope - Inner or outer scope
    - `let` depends on blocks - `{}`
    - `var` depends on functions - `function idk(){}`

  Use declared scope when you're talking about how an identifier is declared.
  Use visibility scope when you're talking about the visibility of a specific identifier.
  Use lexical scope when you want to talk about whether something is "in scope" in relation to a block or function
   -- that is, whether it is available for use.

- Hoisting
  JS engine operates in 2 main phases: creation and execution phase.
  Execution occurs when the program runs code line by line
  Before execution begins, creation phase does something - find all of the variable, function and class declarations. When it
    encounters each of these identifiers, it records the name and designates its scope.
  Hoisting - when code acts like the declarations were moved to the top of their respective scope. In particular, function scoped
    declarations are moved to the functions beginning, and block scoped declarations are moved to the blocks start.
  All declarations get hoisted to the top of their defined scope.
  Hoisting does not change the program.
  When var is hoisted, it is given an initial value of `undefined`. 
  When `let` and `const` are hoisted, they arent given an initial value but are left in an "unset" state.
    - In the temporal dead zone. (TDZ) Remains in TDZ until initialization code runs during execution phase.
  Trying to access a `let` or `const` variable that is in TDZ rasises a reference error but JS is aware that is exists.
  When JS hoists a function declaration to the top of the scope, it hoists the entire function declaration including the body.
  Function expressions follow regular variable hoisting rules since you declare the variable and assign it to a function.
  When a var variable and function declaration have the same name, the var variable gets discared and the function declaration gets
    hoisted to the top.
  Best practice:
    If you must use var, declare all of the variables at the top of the scope.
    Declare `let` and `const` as close to their first usage as possible.
    Declare functions before calling them.
  Hoisting is just a mental model for developers.
  The way hoisting actually works is that during the creation phase, JS engine runs through the code from top down. Then it "hoists"
    what needs to be hoisted and then goes to execution phase to run the program line by line referencing all the declartions from 
    the creation phase.
  
- Strict Mode
  Strict mode has 3 significant changes:
    Elimantes silent errors (silent error occurs when a program does something that is unintended but continues as though nothing is
      wrong)
    Prevents some code that can inhibit JS ebility to optimize a program so that it runs faster
    Prohibits using names and syntax that may conflict with fuuture versions of JS
  Benefits to the developers:
    They prevent or mitigate bugs.
    They help make debugging easier.
    They help your code run faster.
    They help you avoid conflicts with future changes to the language.
  Enable strict mode: `"use strict";`
  Nested functions inherit strict mode from surrounding scope.
  Use of Pragma - tells compiler to process code in a different way
  Cant disable strict mode after enabled
  Can be used within a function body only
  Classes and modules automatically use strict mode naturally
  Cant set a variable without a declarer
  Numbers that look like octal numbers raise an error
  Prevents any number literal from beginning with 0 or -0 except for 0 itself (or 0 with a decimal component, e.g., 0.123).
  (*) prevents you from using function declarations in blocks.
  (*) prevents declaring two properties with the same name in an object.
  prevents declaring two function parameters with the same name.
  prevents using some newer reserved keywords, such as let and static, as variable names.
  prevents you from using the delete operator on a variable name.
  forbids binding of eval and arguments in any way.
  disables access to some properties of the arguments object in functions.
  disables the with statement, a statement whose use is not recommended even in sloppy mode.
  (*) These prohibitions were in effect for ES5, but both are now allowed. However, we recommend that you avoid declaring functions 
    inside blocks and declaring multiple properties with the same name. ESLint will flag these problems.
  When to use strict mode:
    New code that you write
    If adding new function to old code base, use function level strict mode
    Dont use it on an old code bases entire code
  Summary:
  You cannot create global variables implicitly.
  Functions won't use the global object as their implicit context.
  Forgetting to use this in a method raises an error.
  Leading zeros on numeric integers are illegal.

- Closures
  Let a function that was in lexical scope at the function definition point even when that variable is no longer in scope.
  The combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was defined. 
  Closures are created when define a function or method. - Closes over whatever is in its lexical scope where defined. 
  Closures only packet the variables that the function uses.
  Creates an envelope with a pointer to the variable. Any changes made to that variable will be made to the variable within the
    closure for the function
  Closure first looks at its local scope when it encounters a variable name during exec, if it cant find it then it checks the
    envelope to see if it is present there.
  Each time a closure is created, a new set of local variables are put into each respective envelope.

- Partial Function Application
  When you apply some of the functions arguments in the first invokation and another part of the arguments when you call the
    returned function.
  Refers to the creation of a function that can call a second function with fewer arguments than the second function expects.
    The created function applies the remaining arguments.
  PFA requires a reduction in the number of arguments you have to provide when you call a function. If the number of args isnt
    reduced, it isnt partial function application.

- Private Data
  Closure makes it possible to access the value of a variable elsewhere.
  Using closures to restrict data is an excellent way to force other developers to use the intended interface. Via private data,
    access is only granted through the provided methods.
  Restricting access helps protect data integrity since developers must use the interface. 
  Private data also helps prevent the user of an object from becoming dependent on the implementation.
  Even when you restrict access, it's easy to expose data by returning references to that data.
  You shouldn't rely on private data to keep sensitive information hidden. Encryption is the only reasonably safe way to protect 
    such data.

- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
  Expressions that let you define and execute a function in a simple step
  Let you use variable and function names that won't conflict with other names in your code.
  (function(number) {
    return number + 1;
  })(2);   
  Parenthesis around the function tell JS that we want to first evaluate the function as an expression. Then take the return value
    of the expression and use function call to invoke the function
  IIFEs work with arrow functions
  You can also use blocks ({}) to create private scopes but you should use IIFEs
  We can use IIFEs to define private data, instead of having to invoke a function and assign it to a variable, we can use IIFEs
    and it can assign itself to a variable.
  When we talk about private scope, we're talking about how you can use scope to prevent some code from making accidental changes 
    to variables in its outer scope. 
  When we discuss private data, we're talking about encapsulation: making local data inaccessible from the code's outer scope.

- Shorthand Notation
  - Object destructuring:
    let obj = {
      foo: "foo",
      bar: "bar",
      qux: 42,
    };
    let { foo, bar, qux } = obj; // order inside braces is not important
    let { qux: myQux, foo } = obj;
    Also works with function parameters
  - Array destructuring
    let foo = [1, 2, 3];
    let [ first, second, third ] = foo;
  - Spread syntax
    let foo = [3, 7, 11];
    add3(...foo);
    Spread also creates a clone of array
    Also works with objects
  - Rest syntax
    Opposite of spread 
    let foo = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    let [ bar, ...otherStuff ] = foo;
    // bar = 1, otherStuff = [2, 3, 4]

- Modules (CommonJS)
  const readline = require('readline-sync'); --> CommonJS module syntax
  Might need NPM to import the module first^
  module.exports = function name
  const function name = require("./file path");
  Can also export modules through objects:
  module.exports = {
    func1,
    func2,
  };
  Then can use destructuring syntax to import it:
  const { func1, func2 } = require("./file path");
  module: an object that represents the current module
  exports: the name(s) exported by the module (same as module.exports)
  require(moduleName): the function that loads a module
  __dirname: the absolute pathname of the directory that contains the module
  __filename: the absolute pathname of the file that contains the module

- Exceptions
  A program throws an exception when JavaScript encounters an error that it cannot recover from, it issues an error message and 
    usually terminates the program.
  An exception is an event that occurs during program execution to indicate an anomalous or exceptional condition.
  A program can catch and handle exceptions with an exception handler.
  The try block runs the code that might raise an exception, while the catch block tries to do something in response.
  ReferenceError, TypeError, and SyntaxError are all the names of exception objects that inherit from `Error`
  throw new Error("Divide by zero!");
  class DivideByZeroError extends Error {}
  throw new DivideByZeroError("Divide by zero!");
  You should throw an exception when an event occurs that should not be ignored or when the condition is truly anomalous or 
    exceptional.
  You should not throw an exception if you can handle the problem in your local code, or if it's a normal or expected part 
    of the control flow.

- Pure Functions and Side Effects
  Side effects are when a function call performs any of the following:
    1. It reassigns any non-local variable.
    2. It mutates the value of any object referenced by a non-local variable.
    3. It reads from or writes to any data entity (files, network connections, etc.) that is non-local to your program. I/O
    4. It raises an exception.
    5. It calls another function that has any side effects that are not confined to the current function. For instance, if you call 
      a function that mutates an argument, but that argument is local to the calling function, then it isn't a side effect.
  Correct to talk about whether a function call has a side effect
  console.log , readline, new Date, Math.random --> all are side effects
  Pure functions:
    1. Have no side effects.
    2. Given the same set of arguments, the function always returns the same value during the function's lifetime. This rule implies 
      that the return value of a pure function depends solely on its arguments.
  Nothing else in the program can influence the function during the function's lifetime

- Asynchronous programming (setTimeout, setInterval)
  Asynchronous functions, as opposed to synchronous functions, are functions that don't block execution for the rest of the program 
    while they execute.
  Said differently, asynchronous functions run concurrently with other operations so that the caller doesn't have to wait for the 
    task to finish running.
  setTimeout() is one of the simplest ways to run code asynchronously. It takes two arguments: a callback function and the time to 
    delay execution of the callback, in milliseconds (1/1000th of a second or 1 ms). It sets a timer that waits until the specified 
    delay elapses, then invokes the callback.
  setInterval() invokes the callback repeatedly at intervals until told to stop.
  clearInterval() --> cancel the repetitive execution
  var id = setInterval(save, 10000);
  // Later, perhaps after the user submits the form
  clearInterval(id);
